        <h2>Bring Yourself Back to The Present Moment</h2>
        <p><b>Are you dealing with stress, anxiety, racing thoughts, overwhelming emotions or inconsistent sleeping patterns?</b></p>
        <p>The body scan mediation brings awareness to built up tension in the body, as physical stress can go unchecked. But, by reconsigning and addressing discomfort in your body with this mediation, you'll improve your sleep, lower stress levels and stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system, which will encourage relaxation and have your body feeling recharged, centred and grounded in the present moment.</p>
        <p><em>Whether you're experienced or new to body scan, our helpful animation below will guide you to gradually bring awareness to each body part, starting from head to toes.</em><p>

            <h4>Step 1:</h4>
            <h3>Release Tension</h3>
            <p>When the light on the animation below turns blue, identify and relax any tension in your muscles - perhaps furrowed brows, clenched jaw, tights shoulders and chest, or clenched fists and calves.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="steps">
            <h4>Step 2:</h4>
            <h3>Embrace Sensations</h3>
            <p>As the light turns purple, notice any sensation in your body without judgment or need to change them. This could be tingling, pulsing, warmth, coolness, heaviness or even the rhythm of your heartbeat.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="steps">
            <h4>Step 3:</h4>
            <h3>Follow Your Breath</h3>
            <p>When you're ready, find a comfortable position and start breathing slowly and deeply, allow the warmth of each breath to fill your body.</p>
