<p class="benefitsparagraph">Do you feel that all around you is constant noise, chaos and clutter? Do you feel that to find the peace, you need to go be far away? A change of scene can be incredibly powerful, but so can a change of perspective. By grounding yourself in the present moment, you will find the pockets of peace that exist where you are.</p>

            <h2>Step 1</h2>
            <p>Wherever you are, whatever youâ€™re doing, walking, standing or sitting. Find an object, or an element like the sky, trees, water or textures around you. Bring your attention to it by softening your gaze.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="steps">
            <h2>Step 2</h2>
            <p>Keep your gaze on the chosen object and begin to breathe slowly and deeply. Noticing all the sound around you. Accept that they are part of the experience but you are centring the peace that exists.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="steps">
            <h2>Step 3</h2>
            <p>Continue to let all the noise that is happening around wash over you. Stay in this space until your attention brings you  back to your original focus. But keep the peace you felt  in previous moment with you.</p>
